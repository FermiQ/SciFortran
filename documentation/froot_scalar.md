- **Outputs:** [Details to be filled manually or by more advanced parsing]

### Subroutine: `bisect`
- **Signature:** `Subroutine bisect(f,x1,x2,eps,niter,flag)`
- **Purpose:** Find root to equation f(x)=0 on [x1,x2] interval
  flag  - indicator of success
  >0 - a single root found, flag=number of iterations
  0 - no solutions for the bisectional method
  <0 - not a root but singularity, flag=number of iterations
- **Inputs:** [Details to be filled manually or by more advanced parsing]
- **Outputs:** [Details to be filled manually or by more advanced parsing]

### Function: `f`
- **Signature:** `Function f(x)`
- **Purpose:** No specific description available.
- **Inputs:** [Details to be filled manually or by more advanced parsing]
- **Outputs:** [Details to be filled manually or by more advanced parsing]

### Subroutine: `fzero`
- **Signature:** `Subroutine fzero(f,b,c,iflag,rguess,tol_rel,tol_abs)`
- **Purpose:** Input, real ( kind = 8 ) R, a (better) guess of a zero of F which could
  help in speeding up convergence.  If F(B) and F(R) have opposite signs,
  a root will be found in the interval (B,R); if not, but F(R) and F(C)
  have opposite signs, a root will be found in the interval (R,C);
  otherwise, the interval (B,C) will be searched for a possible root.
  When no better guess is known, it is recommended that R be set to B or C;
  because if R is not interior to the interval (B,C), it will be ignored.

  Input, real ( kind = 8 ) RE, the relative error used for RW in the
  stopping criterion.  If the input RE is less than machine precision,
  then RW is set to approximately machine precision.

  Input, real ( kind = 8 ) AE, the absolute error used in the stopping
  criterion.  If the given interval (B,C) contains the origin, then a
  nonzero value should be chosen for AE.

  Output, integer IFLAG, a status code.  The user must check IFLAG
  after each call.  Control returns to the user in all cases.

  1, B is within the requested tolerance of a zero.
  the interval (b,c) collapsed to the requested
  tolerance, the function changes sign in (b,c), and
  f(x) decreased in magnitude as (b,c) collapsed.

  2, F(B) = 0.  however, the interval (b,c) may not have
  collapsed to the requested tolerance.

  3, B may be near a singular point of f(x).
  the interval (b,c) collapsed to the requested tolerance and
  the function changes sign in (b,c), but
  f(x) increased in magnitude as (b,c) collapsed,i.e.
  max ( ABS ( f(b in) ), ABS ( f(c in) ) ) < ABS ( f(b out) ).

  4, no change in sign of f(x) was found although the
  interval (b,c) collapsed to the requested tolerance.
  the user must examine this case and decide whether
  b is near a local minimum of f(x), or B is near a
  zero of even multiplicity, or neither of these.

  5, too many (more than 500) function evaluations used.
