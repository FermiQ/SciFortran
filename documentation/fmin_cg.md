## Key Components

### Module: `fmin_cg`
- **Purpose:** Overview not automatically extracted.
- **Contains:** `fmin_cg_df`, `fmin_cg_f`, `df`

### Subroutine: `fmin_cg_df`
- **Signature:** `Subroutine fmin_cg_df(p,f,df,iter,fret,ftol,itmax,istop,iverbose,err)`
- **Purpose:** +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
  PURPOSE  : Minimize the Chi^2 distance using conjugate gradient
  Adapted by FRPRM subroutine from NumRec (10.6)
  Given a starting point P that is a vector of length N,
  the Fletcher-Reeves-Polak-Ribiere minimisation is performed
  n a functin FUNC,using its gradient as calculated by a
  routine DFUNC. The convergence tolerance on the function
  value is input as FTOL.
  Returned quantities are:
  - P (the location of the minimum),
  - ITER (the number of iterations that were performed),
  - FRET (the minimum value of the function).
  The routine LINMIN is called to perform line minimisations.
  Minimisation routines: DFPMIN, D/LINMIN, MNBRAK, D/BRENT and D/F1DIM
  come from Numerical Recipes.
  NOTE: this routine makes use of abstract interface to communicate
  with routines contained elsewhere. an easier way would be to include
  the routines inside each of the two following fmin_cg routines.
