## Key Components

### Module: `functions_zerf`
- **Purpose:** Overview not automatically extracted.
- **Contains:** `zerf`, `wpop`

### Function: `zerf`
- **Signature:** `Function zerf(z)`
- **Purpose:** This is an error function of a complex argument, which uses wpop(z).
- **Inputs:** [Details to be filled manually or by more advanced parsing]
- **Outputs:** [Details to be filled manually or by more advanced parsing]

### Function: `wpop`
- **Signature:** `Function wpop(z)`
- **Purpose:** A modified version of algorithm 680, rewritten in Fortran 2008.

  the complex error-function, ACM Trans. Math. Software 16:38-46, 1990.
  and

  complex error function, ACM Trans. Math. Software 16:47, 1990.

  Given a complex number z, this function computes
  the value of the Faddeeva-function w(z) = exp(-z**2)*erfc(-i*z),
  where erfc is the complex complementary error-function and i
  means sqrt(-1).  The accuracy of the algorithm for z in the 1st
  and 2nd quadrant is 14 significant digits; in the 3rd and 4th
  it is 13 significant digits outside a circular region with radius
  0.126 around a zero of the function.
