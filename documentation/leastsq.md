## Key Components

### Module: `leastsq`
- **Purpose:** Overview not automatically extracted.
- **Contains:** `leastsq_lmdif_func`, `func`, `leastsq_lmdif1_func2sub`, `leastsq_lmdif_sub`, `func`, `leastsq_lmdif1_sub2sub`, `leastsq_lmder_func`, `func`, `dfunc`, `leastsq_lmder1_func2sub`, `leastsq_lmder_sub`, `func`, `dfunc`, `leastsq_lmder1_sub2sub`

### Subroutine: `leastsq_lmdif_func`
- **Signature:** `Subroutine leastsq_lmdif_func(func,a,m,tol,info)`
- **Purpose:** LMDIF INTERFACE:
  solve M nonlinear equations in N unknowns with M>N
  so f(x)=0 can NOT be solved.
  This look for a solution x so that the norm
  transpose(f(x))*f(x) is minimized.
