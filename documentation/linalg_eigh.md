### Subroutine: `deigh_tridiag`
- **Signature:** `Subroutine deigh_tridiag(D,U,Ev,Irange,Vrange)`
- **Purpose:** = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
  = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
  = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found
  = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU] will be found.
  = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
  For RANGE = 'V' or 'I' and IU - IL < N - 1, DSTEBZ and
  DSTEIN are called
