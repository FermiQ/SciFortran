## Key Components

### Module: `interpolate_cubspl_routines`
- **Purpose:** Overview not automatically extracted.
- **Contains:** `cubspl`, `ppvalu`, `interv`

### Subroutine: `cubspl`
- **Signature:** `Subroutine cubspl(tau, c, n, ibcbeg, ibcend)`
- **Purpose:** ***********************************************************************
  ! CUBSPL defines an interpolatory cubic spline.
  Discussion:
  A tridiagonal linear system for the unknown slopes S(I) of
  F at TAU(I), I=1,..., N, is generated and then solved by Gauss
  elimination, with S(I) ending up in C(2,I), for all I.
  Parameters:

  Input, real ( kind = 8 ) TAU(N), the abscissas or X values of
  the data points.  The entries of TAU are assumed to be
  strictly increasing.

  Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, the number of data points.  N is
  assumed to be at least 2.

  Input/output, real ( kind = 8 ) C(4,N).
  On input, if IBCBEG or IBCBEG is 1 or 2, then C(2,1)
  or C(2,N) should have been set to the desired derivative
  values, as described further under IBCBEG and IBCEND.
  On output, C contains the polynomial coefficients of
  the cubic interpolating spline with interior knots
  TAU(2) through TAU(N-1).
  In the interval interval (TAU(I), TAU(I+1)), the spline
  F is given by
  F(X) =
  C(1,I) +
  C(2,I) * H +
  C(3,I) * H**2 / 2 +
  C(4,I) * H**3 / 6.
  where H=X-TAU(I).  The routine PPVALU may be used to
  evaluate F or its derivatives from TAU, C, L=N-1,
  and K=4.

  Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) IBCBEG, IBCEND, boundary condition indicators
  IBCBEG = 0 means no boundary condition at TAU(1) is given.
  In this case, the "not-a-knot condition" is used.  That
  is, the jump in the third derivative across TAU(2) is
  forced to zero.  Thus the first and the second cubic
  polynomial pieces are made to coincide.
  IBCBEG = 1 means the slope at TAU(1) is to equal the
  input value C(2,1).
  IBCBEG = 2 means the second derivative at TAU(1) is
  to equal C(2,1).
  IBCEND = 0, 1, or 2 has analogous meaning concerning the
  boundary condition at TAU(N), with the additional
  information taken from C(2,N).

  C(3,*) and C(4,*) are used initially for temporary storage.

  Store first differences of the TAU sequence in C(3,*).

  Store first divided difference of data in C(4,*).

### Function: `ppvalu`
- **Signature:** `Function ppvalu(break, coef, l, k, x, jderiv)`
- **Purpose:** ***********************************************************************

  ! PPVALU evaluates a piecewise polynomial function or its derivative.

  Discussion:

  PPVALU calculates the value at X of the JDERIV-th derivative of
  the piecewise polynomial function F from its piecewise
  polynomial representation.

  The interval index I, appropriate for X, is found through a
  call to INTERV.  The formula for the JDERIV-th derivative
  of F is then evaluated by nested multiplication.

  The J-th derivative of F is given by:

  (d**J) F(X) =
  COEF(J+1,I) + H * (
  COEF(J+2,I) + H * (
  ...
  COEF(K-1,I) + H * (
  COEF(K,  I) / (K-J-1) ) / (K-J-2) ... ) / 2 ) / 1

  with

  H = X - BREAK(I)

  and

  I = max ( 1, max ( J, BREAK(J) <= X, 1 <= J <= L ) ).

  Parameters:

  Input, real ( kind = 8 ) BREAK(L+1), real COEF(*), integer L, the
  piecewise polynomial representation of the function F to be evaluated.

  Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) K, the order of the polynomial pieces that
  make up the function F.
  The usual value for K is 4, signifying a piecewise
  cubic polynomial.

  Input, real ( kind = 8 ) X, the point at which to evaluate F or
  of its derivatives.

  Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) JDERIV, the order of the derivative to be
  evaluated.  If JDERIV is 0, then F itself is evaluated,
  which is actually the most common case.  It is assumed
  that JDERIV is zero or positive.

  Output, real ( kind = 8 ) PPVALU, the value of the JDERIV-th
  derivative of F at X.

### Subroutine: `interv`
- **Signature:** `Subroutine interv(xt, lxt, x, left, mflag)`
- **Purpose:** ********************************************************************

  ! INTERV brackets a real value in an ascending vector of values.

  Discussion:

  The XT array is a set of increasing values.  The goal of the routine
  is to determine the largest index I so that XT(I) <= X.

  The routine is designed to be efficient in the common situation
  that it is called repeatedly, with X taken from an increasing
  or decreasing sequence.

  This will happen when a piecewise polynomial is to be graphed.
  The first guess for LEFT is therefore taken to be the value
  returned at the previous call and stored in the local variable ILO.

  A first check ascertains that ILO < LXT.  This is necessary
  since the present call may have nothing to do with the previous
  call.  Then, if

  XT(ILO) <= X < XT(ILO+1),

  we set LEFT = ILO and are done after just three comparisons.

  Otherwise, we repeatedly double the difference ISTEP = IHI - ILO
  while also moving ILO and IHI in the direction of X, until

  XT(ILO) <= X < XT(IHI)

  after which we use bisection to get, in addition, ILO + 1 = IHI.
  The value LEFT = ILO is then returned.

  range of the data.
