## Overview

The `SF_SPARSE` module in SciFortran serves as a primary handler for sparse matrices. It provides a high-level interface to data structures and operations for matrices, primarily focusing on re-exporting functionalities for different sparse formats like Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) and Compressed Sparse Column (CSC), which are implemented in dedicated sub-modules. Both real (`real(8)`) and complex (`complex(8)`) data types are supported.

This module acts as a central point, aggregating and making accessible features from several specialized sub-modules:
-   `SF_SPARSE_COMMON`: Defines a base `sparse_matrix` type and common utility functions and subroutines.
-   `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSR`: Implements the CSR sparse matrix format (e.g., `sparse_dmatrix_csr`, `sparse_zmatrix_csr`) and its associated methods.
-   `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSC`: Implements the CSC sparse matrix format (e.g., `sparse_dmatrix_csc`, `sparse_zmatrix_csc`) and its associated methods.
-   `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_ALGEBRA`: Provides routines for algebraic operations between sparse matrices (e.g., matrix multiplication).

Users typically interact with the types and procedures made public by the main `SF_SPARSE` module.

## Key Components

### Module: `SF_SPARSE`
-   **Role:** The main user-facing module for sparse matrix operations. It re-exports types, operators, and procedures from underlying specialized modules (`SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSR`, `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSC`, `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_ALGEBRA`), providing a unified interface.
-   **Uses Modules:**
    -   `SF_LINALG` (specifically `deye`, `zeye` - likely for utility or example purposes within the broader sparse context).
    -   `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSR` (for CSR type definitions and operations).
    -   `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSC` (for CSC type definitions and operations).
-   **Key Public Re-exported Types (from CSR/CSC modules):**
    -   `sparse_dmatrix_csr`, `sparse_zmatrix_csr`
    -   `sparse_dmatrix_csc`, `sparse_zmatrix_csc`
-   **Key Public Re-exported Operators & Generic Procedures (from CSR/CSC/Algebra modules):**
    -   Assignment: `=`
    -   Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*` (scalar multiplication), `/` (scalar division)
    -   Matrix Multiplication: `matmul`
    -   Kronecker Product: `.x.` (also aliased as `kron`)
    -   Other: `shape`, `transpose`, `hconjg`

---

### Module: `SF_SPARSE_COMMON`
-   **Role:** Provides fundamental definitions, the base `sparse_matrix` type, and common utility routines used by other `SF_SPARSE_*` modules. It is not typically used directly by the end-user but forms the foundation for the specialized sparse matrix formats.
-   **Uses Modules:**
    -   `SF_LINALG` (specifically `deye`, `zeye`).
-   **Key Public Components:**
    -   **`type :: sparse_matrix`**:
        -   A base (parent) type for various sparse matrix implementations.
        -   Contains common intrinsic properties:
            -   `integer :: Nrow` (Number of rows)
            -   `integer :: Ncol` (Number of columns)
            -   `integer :: Nelements` (Number of non-zero elements)
            -   `logical :: status` (Indicates if the matrix is initialized/valid)
        -   Contains type-bound procedure:
            -   `procedure,pass :: shape => shape_matrix`: Returns the dimensions `[Nrow, Ncol]`.
    -   **`interface :: append`**:
        -   A generic interface for dynamically appending elements to allocatable arrays of different types (`append_I` for integer, `append_D` for real(8), `append_Z` for complex(8)). These procedures are used internally by other sparse routines.
    -   **`subroutine :: sort_array(array, order)`**:
        -   A utility subroutine to sort an integer array and return the permutation `order` that sorts the array. Uses a qsort algorithm.
    -   **`function :: binary_search(Ain, value) result(bsresult)`**:
        -   A recursive function to find the index of `value` within an integer array `Ain`. The array is sorted internally before searching. Returns the index if found, or 0.

### Coordinate (COO) Format
-   [Details for COO format to be added in a subsequent review pass. This format is often a precursor to CSR/CSC but is not directly re-exported by the main `SF_SPARSE` module based on current analysis.]

---

### Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) Format
-   **`type :: sparse_dmatrix_csr`**: For real(8) data.
-   **`type :: sparse_zmatrix_csr`**: For complex(8) data.
-   These types are defined in `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSR` and re-exported by `SF_SPARSE`.
-   **Key Type-Bound Procedures (Methods):**
    -   `init(Nrows, Ncols)`: Initializes an empty sparse matrix.
    -   `free()`: Deallocates internal storage.
    -   `load(dense_matrix)`: Initializes from a dense 2D array.
    -   `dump(dense_matrix_out)`: Converts to a dense 2D array.
    -   `as_matrix() result(dense_matrix)`: Converts to a new dense 2D array.
    -   `insert(value, i, j)`: Adds/inserts an element.
    -   `get(i, j) result(value)`: Retrieves an element.
    -   `shape() result(dims_array)`: Returns `[Nrow, Ncol]`.
    -   `transpose() result(transposed_matrix)`: Returns the transpose.
    -   `dgr() result(dagger_matrix)`: Returns the conjugate transpose.
    -   `conjg() result(conjugated_matrix)` (for complex types): Element-wise conjugate.
-   [Details for CSR format are largely covered by `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSR` and re-exported here. A dedicated review pass will refine CSR-specific details.]

---

### Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) Format
-   **`type :: sparse_dmatrix_csc`**: For real(8) data.
-   **`type :: sparse_zmatrix_csc`**: For complex(8) data.
-   These types are defined in `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSC` and re-exported by `SF_SPARSE`.
-   **Key Type-Bound Procedures (Methods):** Similar to CSR types.
-   [Details for CSC format are largely covered by `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSC` and re-exported here. A dedicated review pass will refine CSC-specific details.]

---

### Sparse Matrix Algebra
-   Operations like matrix multiplication (`matmul`) are provided through `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_ALGEBRA` and re-exported by `SF_SPARSE`.
-   [Details for Algebra routines are largely covered by `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_ALGEBRA` and re-exported here. A dedicated review pass will refine algebra-specific details.]

---

### Construction
Sparse matrices can be constructed directly from dense matrices using the type name as a constructor (these are mapped to specific constructor functions in the CSR/CSC modules):
-   `my_sparse_csr = sparse_dmatrix_csr(dense_real_matrix)`
-   `my_sparse_csc = sparse_zmatrix_csc(dense_complex_matrix)`
   Aliases `as_sparse` and `sparse` may also exist for these constructors.

---

### Operations (Re-exported by `SF_SPARSE`)

#### Assignment (`=`)
-   **`sparse_matrix_A = sparse_matrix_B`**: Deep copy.
-   **`sparse_matrix_A = scalar_value`**: Assigns scalar to *existing* non-zero elements.

#### Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
-   **`C = A + B`**: Element-wise addition.
-   **`C = A - B`**: Element-wise subtraction.
-   **`C = scalar * A`** or **`C = A * scalar`**: Scalar multiplication.
-   **`C = A / scalar`**: Scalar division.

#### Matrix Multiplication (`matmul`)
-   Provided via `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_ALGEBRA`. Supports various CSR/CSC combinations.

#### Kronecker Product (`.x.` or `kron`)
-   Computes Kronecker product. Supports CSR and CSC formats.

#### Other Operations
-   **`transpose(A)`**: Transpose.
-   **`hconjg(A)`**: Hermitian conjugate.

## Important Variables/Constants
The `SF_SPARSE` and `SF_SPARSE_COMMON` modules primarily define types and procedures. No significant public constants are directly exposed by these two modules. Constants specific to algorithms might be defined within the respective `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSR`, `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_CSC`, or `SF_SPARSE_ARRAY_ALGEBRA` modules.

## Usage Examples

**1. Creating and Manipulating a CSR Sparse Matrix (Real):**
```fortran
program test_sf_sparse_csr
  use SF_SPARSE ! Main module to use
  implicit none

  type(sparse_dmatrix_csr) :: smat, smat_t
  real(8), dimension(3,3) :: dense_mat, out_mat
  integer :: i

  ! Initialize a 3x3 dense matrix
  dense_mat = 0.0d0
  dense_mat(1,1) = 1.0; dense_mat(1,3) = 2.0
  dense_mat(2,2) = 5.0
  dense_mat(3,1) = 3.0; dense_mat(3,2) = -1.0

  ! Create sparse matrix from dense matrix using the re-exported type
  smat = sparse_dmatrix_csr(dense_mat)

  ! Insert/add an element
  call smat%insert(0.5d0, 1, 1) ! Adds to existing A(1,1)

  ! Get an element
  print *, "Element (1,1):", smat%get(1,1) ! Should be 1.5
  print *, "Element (1,2) (should be 0):", smat%get(1,2)

  ! Transpose
  smat_t = smat%transpose()

  ! Dump to dense matrix
  out_mat = 0.0d0
  call smat_t%dump(out_mat)
  print *, "Transposed matrix (dense):"
  do i=1,shape(out_mat,1)
    print *, out_mat(i,:)
  end do

  call smat%free()
  call smat_t%free()

end program test_sf_sparse_csr
```

**2. Sparse Matrix Addition:**
```fortran
program test_sparse_add
  use SF_SPARSE ! Main module to use
  implicit none
  type(sparse_dmatrix_csr) :: a, b, c
  real(8), dimension(2,2) :: dense_a, dense_b
  real(8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dense_c_alloc
  integer :: i

  dense_a = reshape([1d0, 0d0, 0d0, 2d0], [2,2])
  dense_b = reshape([0d0, 3d0, 4d0, 0d0], [2,2])

  a = sparse_dmatrix_csr(dense_a)
  b = sparse_dmatrix_csr(dense_b)

  c = a + b

  dense_c_alloc = c%as_matrix() ! Convert result to dense for printing
  print *, "C = A + B (dense form):"
  if (allocated(dense_c_alloc)) then
    do i=1,size(dense_c_alloc,1)
      print *, dense_c_alloc(i,:)
    end do
    deallocate(dense_c_alloc)
  end if
  ! Expected: [[1,3],[4,2]]

  call a%free(); call b%free(); call c%free()
end program test_sparse_add
```
