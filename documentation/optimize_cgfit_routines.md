### Subroutine: `linmin`
- **Signature:** `Subroutine linmin(p,xi,fret,ftol)`
- **Purpose:** +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
  PURPOSE  : Minimization routine
  Given an N dimensional point P and an N dimensional direction
  XI, LINMIN moves and resets P to where the function FUNC(P) takes
  on a minimum
  along the direction XI from P, and replaces XI by the actual vector
  displacement that P was moved.  Also returns FRET the value of
  FUNC at the returned location P.
  This is actually all accomplished by calling the routines
  MNBRAK and BRENT.

  and f(bx) is less than both f(ax) and f(cx)), this routine
  isolates the minimum to a fractional precision of about tol
  using brents method. the abscissa of the minimum is returned
  as xmin, and the minimum function value is returned as brent,
  the returned function value.
