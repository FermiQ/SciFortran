## Key Components

### Module: `brent`
- **Purpose:** Overview not automatically extracted.
- **Contains:** `brent`, `func`, `brent_optimize`, `func`, `shft`, `dbrent_wgrad`, `func`, `dfunc`, `dbrent_nograd`, `func`, `dfunc`, `fgradient_func`, `funcv`, `dbrent_optimize`, `func`, `fjac`, `mov3`, `bracket`, `func`, `swap`, `shft`

### Subroutine: `brent`
- **Signature:** `Subroutine brent(func,xmin,brack,tol,niter)`
- **Purpose:** +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
  PURPOSE  :
  Given a function f, and given a bracketing triplet of abscissas
  ax, bx, cx (such that bx is between ax and cx, and f(bx) is less
  than both f(ax) and f(cx)), this routine isolates the minimum to a
  fractional precision of about tol using Brent’s method. The abscissa
  of the minimum is returned as xmin, and the minimum function value
  is returned as brent, the returned function value.
  Parameters: Maximum allowed number of iterations; golden ratio;
  and a small number that protects against trying to achieve
  fractional accuracy for a minimum that happens to be exactly zero.

  PURPOSE  :
  Given a function f and its derivative function df, and given a
  bracketing triplet of abscissas ax, bx, cx [such that bx is between
  ax and cx, and f(bx) is less than both f(ax) and f(cx)], this
  routine isolates the minimum to a fractional precision of about
  tol using a modification of Brent’s method that uses derivatives.
  The abscissa of the minimum is returned as xmin, and the minimum
  function value is returned as dbrent, the returned function value.
