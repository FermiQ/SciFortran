## An open-source Fortran library for mathematics, science and engineering.

This is a unitary collection of fortran modules and procedures for scientific calculations. The library aims to provide a simple and generic environment for any scientific or mathematic computations. The project is largely inspired by *SciPy* for Python and tries to closely follow its guidelines and naming convention. 

There are large areas that are still not covered.  
Anyone is welcome to contribute or to test the software.
